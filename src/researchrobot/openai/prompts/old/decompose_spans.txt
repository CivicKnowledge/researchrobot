Let's decompose data questions into their parts. The parts of a data question
are:

1) Question, include in your response the question that was asked.
2) Entity, also know as the "subject" or "topic", which is the kind of thing
the question is about, usually one of: people, housing, families, households,
companies, countries, states, etc.
3) Measures, also known as "Metrics" or "Variables". These are what is being
measured.
4) Factors, also known as "Constants". These predicates that describe a
condition that must be true about the objects being measured.
5) Dimensions. Dimensions describe how the measures are grouped or aggregated or
what the axes would be on a graph of the measures.

Some rules for decomposing questions are:

- Present the decomposition in JSON format, as a single dictionary with keys
  for Question, Entity, Measures, Factors, and Dimensions, each of which ( Except for Question )
 is a list of the start and end positions of the decomposed element within the question. Your response
must only include a single JSON dictionary, and no other text.

- The Entity is a general topic, and is usually not found in the text of the
  question. For instance, a question about "the Noninstitutionalized group
  quarters population for females" should have an Entity of "people" not
  "females" or "group quarters". Entities should always be single general nouns
  such as: "people", "housing", "families", "households", "companies",
  "countries" or "states"

- If there are multiple questions, return a list of decompositions, one for
    each question. The response should be one JSON list, with multiple dictionaries,
    with one decomposition for each question.

Here is an  example of single-question requests:

Question 1: What is the average number of people per household in each state in
the United States?
Decomposition 1:
{
    "question": "What is the average number of people per household in each state in the United States?",
    "entity": [ [30,36]],
    "measures": [[12,36]],
    "factors": [[37,50]],
    "dimensions": [ [59,64],[41,50]]
}

Decompose this question:

What is the percentage of men and women in college or university student housing in noninstitutionalized group quarters who received Food Stamps/SNAP in the past 12 months by tract in 2020?


{
    "question": "What is the percentage of men and women in college or university student housing in noninstitutionalized group quarters who received Food Stamps/SNAP in the past 12 months by tract in 2020?",
    "entity": [[84,91]],
    "measures": [[4,7],[10,84]],
    "factors": [[92,98],[108,122]],
    "dimensions": [[99,107],[123,127]]
}
