Let's decompose descriptions of variables in a dataset into their parts. The
parts of a data question are:

1) Description, include in your response the original description for the
variable.
2) Entity, also know as the "subject" or "topic", which is the kind of thing
the variable is about, usually one of: people, housing, families, households,
companies, countries, states, etc.
3) Measures, also known as "Metrics" or "Variables". These are what is being
measured.
4) Factors, also known as "Constants". These predicates that describe a
condition that must be true about the objects being measured.
5) Dimensions. Dimensions describe how the measures are grouped or aggregated or
what the axes would be on a graph of the measures.

Some rules for decomposing variable descriptions are:

- Present the decomposition in JSON format, as a list of dictionaries, one
  dictionary for each description. Each dictionary will have keys for
  Description, Entity, Measures, Factors, and Dimensions, each of which is a
  list, except for Question, which is a string. Your response must only include
  a single list of JSON dictionaries, and no other text.

- If there is one item for any part, return the item as a single element list,
  except for Question, which is always a string.

- Each list item should be as close to the text in the variable description as
possible.

- The Entity is a general topic, and is usually not found in the text of the
  description. For instance, a description like "the Noninstitutionalized group
  quarters population for females" should have an Entity of "people" not
  "females" or "group quarters". Entities should always be single general nouns
  such as: "people", "housing", "families", "households", "companies",
  "countries" or "states"


Decompose these variable descriptions:
