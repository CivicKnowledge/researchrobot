Let's decompose data questions into their parts. The parts of a data question
are:

1) Question, include in your response the question that was asked.
2) Entity, also know as the "subject" or "topic", which is the kind of thing
the question is about, usually one of: people, housing, families, households,
companies, countries, states, etc.
3) Measures, also known as "Metrics" or "Variables". These are what is being
measured.
4) Factors, also known as "Constants". These predicates that describe a
condition that must be true about the objects being measured. Sex, age, poverty status, education and occupation are common factors.
5) Dimensions. Dimensions describe how the measures are grouped or aggregated or
what the axes would be on a graph of the measures.

Some rules for decomposing questions are:

- Present the decomposition in JSON format, as a single dictionary with keys
  for Question, Entity, Measures, Factors, and Dimensions, each of which is a
  list, except for Question, which is a string. Your response must only include
  a single JSON dictionary, and no other text.

- If there is one item for any part, return the item as a single element list,
  except for Question, which is always a string.

- Each list item should be as close to the text in the question as
possible.

- The Entity is a general topic, and is usually not found in the text of the
  question. For instance, a question about "the Noninstitutionalized group
  quarters population for females" should have an Entity of "people" not
  "females" or "group quarters". Entities should always be single general nouns
  such as: "people", "housing", "families", "households", "companies",
  "countries" or "states"

- If there are multiple questions, return a list of decompositions, one for
  each question. The response should be one JSON list, with multiple
  dictionaries, with one decomposition for each question.

- Sex and age are nearly always factors or dimensions, not measures
